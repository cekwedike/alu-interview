ainwater Trapping Task

## Task Description
This task involves writing a function to calculate how much rainwater can be trapped between walls of varying heights. This is akin to looking at a cross-section of a terrain map where each number in an input list represents the height of a wall with a unit width of 1. The goal is to determine the total area (in square units) of water that would be retained after a rainfall, assuming the water gets trapped between these walls.

## Function Prototype
```python
def rain(walls):
    """
    Calculate the amount of rainwater retained after it rains, given a list of wall heights.
    
    Parameters:
    - walls: List[int]. A list of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a wall.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The total amount of rainwater retained.
    """
```

### Parameters
- **walls** (`List[int]`): A list of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a wall with a unit width of 1.

### Returns
- **int**: The function returns an integer indicating the total amount of rainwater retained. If the list is empty, the function returns `0`.

### Assumptions
- The list represents a cross-section of walls with each element indicating the height of a wall.
- The width of each wall is considered to be 1 unit.
- The ends of the list (before index 0 and after index `walls[-1]`) are not considered as walls, meaning they will not retain water. Thus, water at the ends will not be counted as retained.
- The input list will only contain non-negative integers.

### Example
Given the list of wall heights `[3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]`, the function should calculate the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped, which in this case would be `8`.

```python
print(rain([3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]))
# Output: 8
```

### Explanation
In the given example, the arrangement of walls can trap water in several places. The function calculates the total volume of these trapped waters and returns the sum as the total amount of rainwater retained.

## Implementation Notes
- The function should efficiently handle lists of varying sizes.
- Consider edge cases, such as an empty list, a list with all elements being the same height, and lists where no water can be trapped.

This task requires understanding of algorithms, particularly those related to array manipulation and optimization techniques to solve problems related to trapping rainwater efficiently.
